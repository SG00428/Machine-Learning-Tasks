# Linear Regression on TV Advertisement Spend and Sales

## Overview

This project performs a simple linear regression to analyze the relationship between TV advertisement spending and sales. The dataset used contains various advertising channels, but for this analysis, we focus on the **TV advertisement spending** to predict **Sales**.

## Files and Code Structure

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
    - The dataset is loaded from `Advertising.csv`.
    - For this analysis, only the "TV" column is used as the feature (`X`), and "Sales" is used as the target (`y`).

3. **Model Training**
    - The model is trained using Linear Regression and then used to predict the sales.

4. **Model Evaluation**
        - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
        - **R-squared (RÂ²)**

5. **Visualization**
    - A scatter plot displays the relationship between **TV Advertisement Spend** and **Sales**.
